# Home Loan Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the approval of home loan applications based on various applicant features such as income, loan amount, and credit history. The model is built using machine learning techniques to assist financial institutions in making more efficient and data-driven lending decisions. 

## Features:
- The dataset includes features such as applicant income, co-applicant income, loan amount, loan term, credit history, and other relevant information.
- Preprocessing steps like handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables are applied to clean the dataset.
- The model is trained using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, and evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

The final model aims to achieve at least 70% accuracy to ensure reliable predictions.
